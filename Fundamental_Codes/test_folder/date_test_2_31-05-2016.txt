From this chapter, you know the shutil.move() function can be used to rename files: 
Its arguments are the name of the file to rename and the new filename. Because this
 function exists in the shutil module, you must import that module ?.

But before renaming the files, you need to identify which files you want to rename.
 Filenames with dates such as spam5-4-1984.txt and 01-03-2014eggs.zip should be renamed, 
while filenames without dates such as littlebrother.epub can be ignored.

You can use a regular expression to identify this pattern. After importing the re module 
at the top, call re.compile() to create a Regex object ?. Passing re.VERBOSE for the second 
argument ? will allow whitespace and comments in the regex string to make it more readable.

The regular expression string begins with ^(.*?) to match any text at the beginning of 
the filename that might come before the date. The ((0|1)?\d) group matches the month.
 The first digit can be either 0 or 1, so the regex matches 12 for December but also 
02 for February.
 This digit is also optional so that the month can be 04 or 4 for April. The group for 
the day is ((0|1|2|3)?\d) and follows similar logic; 3, 03, and 31 are all valid numbers
 for days. (Yes, this regex will accept some invalid dates such as 31-4-2014, 2-29-2013,
 and 15-0-2014. 
Dates have a lot of thorny special cases that can be easy to miss. But for simplicity, 
the regex in this program works well enough.),
